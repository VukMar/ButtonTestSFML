# ButtonTestSFML

Hello everyone i am new to github and programing in general.

This is my attempt in creating a button and displayeable/changable text using SFML library.
(You need to have SFML installed to make any changes)


The code is not that great since this is a learning project. it has a crucial bug(Button works on being pressed not released)
that i cant get around and was hoping, that people here will give it a look and see what i am doing wrong and say 
something about my aproach.
This is raw code, place it in a folder and compile.(If you want to test it)

All help is appreciated!

Thanks everyone and i am looking forward to yor comments.
